# Uplink Roadmap

A fast, secure, IRCv3-featured IRC client built with Qt6 and C++.  
Default network: **irc.linuxdojo.org:6697** — channel **#uplink**

---

## Completed

- [x] Project scaffold — Qt6/C++17, CMake, directory structure
- [x] Config loader — TOML format via toml++, auto-creates `~/.config/uplink/config.toml` on first run
- [x] First-run nick dialog — prompts for nick if config has placeholder `yournick`
- [x] IRC connection — SSL/TLS via QSslSocket, CAP LS 302 negotiation
- [x] IRCv3 message tag parser — full prefix + tag parsing
- [x] CAP negotiation — requests multi-prefix, away-notify, server-time, message-tags, batch, labeled-response
- [x] Full IRC numerics — 001 welcome, 332/353/366 topic+names, MOTD, ISUPPORT, nick-in-use fallback
- [x] IRC commands — JOIN, PART, QUIT, NICK, KICK, MODE, TOPIC, PRIVMSG, NOTICE, CTCP ACTION
- [x] Data model — Message, Channel, ServerSession, SessionModel
- [x] Message buffer cap — 2000 messages per channel (RAM-flat on long sessions)
- [x] Nick list — sorted by prefix rank (~&@%+), live updates on JOIN/PART/QUIT/NICK
- [x] Main window UI — toolbar, sidebar (server/channel tree), chat view, nick list panel, topic bar, input bar
- [x] Nick list panel — embedded on the right side of the chat view in a QSplitter
- [x] Topic bar — shows topic text + channel modes, toggleable from hamburger
- [x] Hamburger menu — About, Documentation (stub), App Icon picker, Theme picker, topic/nick/emoji toggles
- [x] Persistent Preferences dialog — hamburger now opens a non-modal QDialog; stays open while browsing themes/toggles; replaces dismiss-on-click QMenu
- [x] Preferences UI rework (v0.9.2) — Manage Servers + Documentation at top; theme as collapsible stay-open list (arrow keys browse, Enter/click applies); App Icon as radio buttons; About removed; Nick Brackets dropdown compact; Enter-triggers-Font-Config bug fixed
- [x] Hamburger restored as dropdown — ☰ opens About Uplink, Documentation, Preferences, Open Config, Reload Config
- [x] Open Config / Reload Config — Open Config opens config.toml in system editor; Reload Config restarts the app to apply all changes (v0.17.1: changed from partial hot-reload to full restart)
- [x] Input commands — /join, /j, /part, /nick, /me, /msg, /quote, /raw, /quit, /ping, /invite, /mode, /op, /deop, /voice, /devoice, /ban, /unban, /clear
- [x] Raw command passthrough — unrecognized /CMD inputs sent directly as raw IRC lines; /REHASH, /SAMODE, /GLOBOPS etc. work without /quote prefix (v0.16.1)
- [x] System tray — minimize to tray on close, left-click shows window, right-click menu (Show/Quit)
- [x] Unread badge — tray icon gets red dot on unread messages; green dot for mention/PM when window not focused
- [x] Theme loader — 55 TOML themes, applies as QSS stylesheet, live switching from hamburger
- [x] App icon — 3 switchable styles (Node N, Tower, Hub Spoke); SVG dark / PNG light variants; auto-selects based on active theme palette brightness; tray icon locked to hub-spoke SVG (v0.16.2)
- [x] About dialog — static Node-Relay-Tower.png logo (128×128), version, description (v0.16.2)
- [x] Signal ordering fix — config loads after MainWindow connects signals
- [x] Version baked into binary — `version.h` generated from CMake `PROJECT_VERSION` at build time
- [x] Full documentation — configuration.md, commands.md, faq.md, ircv3.md, keyboard-shortcuts.md (beginner-friendly, real examples)
- [x] How-To guide — docs/howto.html: left-side nav tree, step-by-step from install to tweaks, platform tabs, callout boxes, scroll-spy; linked from GitHub Pages and README
- [x] GitHub repo — public, branch-protected, invite-only contributions; renamed to uplink/UplinkIRC (v0.16.2)
- [x] GitHub Pages landing page — https://uplink.github.io/Uplink/
- [x] README beautification — badges, icon gallery, feature tables, annotated config, commands table, download buttons

- [x] Local directory renamed to Uplink; all paths, hooks, and memory updated (v0.16.2 housekeeping)
- [x] Release CI fixed — all three platform builds produce Uplink-v0.16.2-* artifacts (v0.16.2 housekeeping)
- [x] Nick completion — Tab key completes nicks in input bar
- [x] Slash command tab completion — Tab also completes /commands (e.g. /pi → /ping)

- [x] Colored nicks — consistent hash color per nick in chat and nick list
- [x] In-app Documentation panel — Hamburger → Documentation opens tabbed help viewer
- [x] Documentation search — live search bar in the tab bar (right of Shortcuts); jumps to first match in active tab; re-runs on tab switch

- [x] Save theme + icon choice to config.toml (persists across restarts)
- [x] about.png background normalized — logo visible on both light and dark backgrounds
- [x] IRC color code rendering — mIRC bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, reverse, 16 colors (fg+bg)
- [x] Per-widget font size config — Font Config dialog in hamburger; independent sizes for all UI zones; persists to config.toml
- [x] Typing indicator — IRCv3 draft/typing TAGMSG; debounced send + receive; hamburger toggle
- [x] Extended slash commands — /away, /back, /motd, /whois, /topic, /kick, /notice, /version, /ctcp, /sysinfo, /help
- [x] /sysinfo rewritten (v2) — OS/CPU/MEM/GPU/UP format; GPU via vulkaninfo (deviceName + renderer), lspci fallback; uptime from /proc/uptime

- [x] Channel info bar — shows #channel (modes) ServerName; modes from 324 RPL_CHANNELMODEIS
- [x] Sidebar server item clickable — opens server buffer, shows config short name
- [x] Server buffer unread indicator — server name turns purple in sidebar when unread notices arrive (CTCP replies, NickServ, etc.); clears on focus; CTCP replies routed through noticeReceived so they count as unread
- [x] Colored nicks hamburger toggle — was config-only, now in UI
- [x] GitHub Actions CI — builds on every push across Linux, Windows, macOS
- [x] GitHub Actions release workflow — builds platform binaries on tag push, attaches to GitHub releases

- [x] Right-click nick in chat view — same context menu as nick list; nicks rendered as nick: anchors in HTML
- [x] Tray icon left-click toggles window visibility
- [x] Unread dot indicator in sidebar — 🔥 for activity, 💡 red for nick mentions; clears on focus
- [x] Sidebar flat list — Halloy-style: no arrows, servers as section headers, connected icon, dock titles removed
- [x] Font Config: Network Name and Typing Indicator size controls
- [x] Info bar always visible with channel, modes, network, user count
- [x] Topic display — separate drop-down area with chat-window background, toggled by Show Topic
- [x] Panel detach/float — sidebar panel could be detached and re-docked (removed in v0.7.12; sidebar is now a fixed embedded panel)
- [x] Topic bar layout — network/user count next to channel label, not far right
- [x] /topic channel-name parsing — `/topic #channel text` correctly separates channel from topic text
- [x] Topic bar background matches input area — info bar visually joins the input row
- [x] Mode string spacing — gap between `(modes)` and `* Network` fixed
- [x] Clickable URLs in topic display — http/https links open in browser
- [x] Toolbar removed — nothing above the info bar; all panels start flush at top
- [x] Minimal dock title bar — sidebar had a slim bar with a ⧉ float button (replaced in v0.7.12 by gear toggle in the info bar)
- [x] Hamburger menu relocated — now in topic bar, left of #channel label
- [x] Status bar text shrunk — 7pt via QSS
- [x] Clickable URLs in chat messages — http/https links in PRIVMSG, actions, and notices open in browser
- [x] Reconnect with exponential backoff — auto-reconnect on unexpected disconnect; 5s→10s→20s→40s→60s; deliberate quit disables it
- [x] Sidebar right-click context menus — server items: Disconnect/Reconnect; channel items: Rejoin/Leave/Close; PM queries: Close Query
- [x] v0.3.0 released
- [x] macOS release CI fixed — MACOSX_BUNDLE property set; .app bundle produced; macdeployqt succeeds; v0.3.0 re-tagged and all three platform builds pass
- [x] Link preview — hover tooltip shows domain + page title; inline card with og:image thumbnail auto-appears below live URL messages
- [x] Link preview fixed for regular URLs — redirect following, proper UA, 32 KB buffer, multi-line title regex
- [x] Link preview redesigned (v0.12.0) — title+domain on top, image below; 360×220 scale; ChatBrowser subclass decodes data: URIs so images actually render; WhatsApp/2 UA fixes YouTube and heavy sites
- [x] Link right-click menu (v0.12.0) — Copy URL / Open URL / Hide Preview; left-click opens browser; double-menu bug fixed by moving handler to QContextMenu event
- [x] Link preview show/hide toggle (v0.12.1) — right-click a hidden-preview URL shows "Show Preview"; card restores from cache without re-fetch; hiddenPreviews QSet tracks state per channel
- [x] Notification icon-only indicators (v0.12.0) — removed color changes on channel names; 💡/🔥 icons are the sole unread indicators; eliminates layout shift
- [x] Dark banner — uplink-top-banner-dark.svg used in README and About dialog
- [x] `/nick` label update — changing nick now immediately reflects in the input bar nick label
- [x] Direct image URL preview — `.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.webp` links show a thumbnail card without HTML parsing
- [x] Typing indicator layout — moved from chat-view overlay (covered text) to dedicated layout row; collapses when idle
- [x] FreeBSD download badge in README — links to build-from-source instructions; signals FreeBSD support
- [x] Cross-platform OS characters image on GitHub project page
- [x] TLS certificate verification — certificates are now verified; invalid certs disconnect with an error message instead of being silently accepted
- [x] Credential redaction — `PASS`, `AUTHENTICATE`, and NickServ `IDENTIFY` payloads never appear in the raw log
- [x] Config file hardened — `config.toml` written with owner-only `0600` permissions; save is atomic via `QSaveFile`; all string values properly TOML-escaped
- [x] Link preview LAN protection — private/loopback/link-local addresses blocked from auto-fetch; prevents internal network probing via chat links
- [x] CTCP rate limiting — `VERSION` and `PING` replies limited to once per nick per 5 s; PING echo payload capped at 32 bytes
- [x] Inbound DoS protection — input buffer capped at 64 KB; oversized IRC lines (> 8 KB) dropped; `BATCH` open count (max 8) and message count (max 1 000) bounded
- [x] QTextBrowser block count bounded — chat view kept in sync with message model cap; no unbounded RAM growth on long sessions
- [x] Duplicate disconnect signal fixed — `onErrorOccurred` no longer double-emits or double-schedules reconnect
- [x] Link preview image decode safety — `QImageReader` dimension check before decode; images > 4096×4096 rejected; scaled during decode, not after
- [x] Channel preview hash capped — per-channel link preview store evicts oldest at 100 entries

## Planned — Polish + Distribution

- [ ] Virtual scrolling — render only visible messages (performance on busy channels)
- [x] Window state persistence — sidebar width and nick panel width saved via QSettings on quit, restored on launch; sidebar is drag-resizable
- [x] Nick panel width persistence — QSplitter position saved via QSettings on quit, restored on launch
- [x] Config editor UI — Manage Servers dialog covers server-level editing
- [x] Emoji picker — searchable popup grid with :shortcode: autocomplete and auto-substitution
- [x] Bot nick indicators — 🤖/👾 shown for +B mode nicks; auto-detected on join via WHO reply; randomly assigned per nick each session, cached for stability
- [x] Configurable nick brackets — `nick_brackets` in `[ui]`; `"<>"` `"[]"` `"::::"` `""` supported; also configurable live from Hamburger → Nick Brackets
- [x] Autojoin regression fix — editing a server in the GUI no longer wipes auto-join channels; Auto-join field added to Add/Edit Server dialog
- [x] Autojoin Windows fix — config loading now uses Qt file I/O instead of toml::parse_file; paths with non-ASCII characters load correctly on Windows
- [x] Simplified channel config — `channels = "#uplink, #linux"` replaces `[[server.channels]]` array-of-tables; Reload Config syncs changes live via SessionModel::syncServers()
- [x] Channel key persistence — channels saved as `[[server.channel]]` tables with `name` + `key`; backward-compatible load of old comma-string format (v0.13.0)
- [x] Close/Close Query in sidebar — right-clicking a channel shows Close (PARTs + removes buffer); right-clicking a PM query shows Close Query (removes buffer)
- [x] Channel focus on join — joining a channel now always switches focus to it
- [x] Nick panel redesign — replaced detachable QDockWidget with embedded panel in QSplitter; gear button (⚙) in header animates a full spin before toggling the user list; gear and user count remain visible when collapsed; panel background matches chat buffer color across all themes
- [x] Sidebar gear toggle — ⚙ button in the topic bar collapses the server/channel list; hamburger and gear stay pinned in the topic bar at all times (kBtnZoneMinW=48px floor); only the list collapses beneath them
- [x] Native Windows style — windows11 Qt style by default; no alien dark theme on fresh installs
- [x] FreeBSD port skeleton — `packaging/freebsd/`: Makefile, pkg-descr, pkg-plist; uses GH source tarball; needs `make makesum` + qt6-keychain port verification before submission
- [x] AppImage packaging for Linux — build-appimage.sh; linuxdeploy + Qt plugin; zsync metadata embedded; release.yml uploads .AppImage + .AppImage.zsync; plugin strip patched for .relr.dyn (v0.15.0)
- [x] Auto-bump release docs — update-docs job in release.yml replaces all version strings in README.md and docs/index.html after each successful tag build; no manual bump needed on future releases
- [x] Service shortcuts — /ns /cs /bs /ms aliases for NickServ/ChanServ/BotServ/MemoServ; /query opens PM without sending; /oper for IRC operator login (v0.15.0)
- [x] Right-click copy in chat view — selecting text and right-clicking shows Copy (v0.14.0)
- [x] Theme-aware icons — hamburger menu and gear buttons use m_theme.text; link preview card hardcoded dark (v0.14.0)
- [x] In-app update check UI — "Check for Updates" in hamburger menu; fetches GitHub releases API, parses tag_name, compares UPLINK_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH; shows "Update Available" or "Up to Date" message box
- [x] Event message visual polish — join/part/quit/nick lines render at 82% font size; part/quit/kick color softened to #e06b6b for dark backgrounds (v0.18.2)
- [x] QSS visual polish overhaul — rounded inputs with focus rings, themed checkboxes/radio/tabs/tooltips, floating scrollbars, pill-shaped sidebar selection, menu border-radius and separators (v0.19.0)
- [x] Sidebar fitted pill highlight — custom SidebarDelegate draws rounded rect sized to text width; no full-row highlight; hover shift eliminated; selected text always readable (v0.19.0)
- [x] Topic toggle button theme integration — both primary panel and channel pane topic buttons use #topicToggle QSS rule; removed palette(mid)/palette(highlight) inline stylesheets; always visible in single-window mode (v0.19.0)
- [x] Topic button speech bubble icon — custom QPainter icon replaces text label; muted when collapsed, accent when open; ChannelPane::setTopicIcon() API; updates on theme change (v0.19.1)
- [x] Floating rounded input bar — separator line removed; bar blends into chat area via bufferBg; QLineEdit gets border-radius pill shape (v0.19.1)
- [x] Rounded chat panel with padding — RoundedPane widget clips all chat content (panes splitter + children) to a 10 px rounded rect via setMask(); 8 px right/bottom padding shows sidebarBg for contrast; sidebar toggle balances left margin to match (v0.19.2)
- [x] MD3-inspired UI pass — pill buttons (20px radius via PillButton QPainter subclass), rounder inputs/menus/tooltips, Material Symbols SVG icons for hamburger/gear/all menu items, sidebar pill highlight padding fixed, row heights via sizeHint delegates (v0.20.0)
- [x] Self-signed cert fingerprint pinning — per-server accept/reject/pin dialog on first connect; SHA-256 fingerprint saved to config; mismatch disconnects with warning; IrcClient::abort() for clean reject (v0.20.0)

## Performance & Maintainability Backlog

Items from the lightweight code review (2026-06-04). Ordered roughly by value / effort.

### Near term
- [x] `/sysinfo` async — run process collection off the UI thread; cache result for the session; add hard global timeout
- [x] DCC receive hardening — configurable max receive size; write to `.part` file and rename on success; delete partial on failure/cancel; check available disk space before starting
- [x] Link preview queue — replace abort-on-new-fetch with a small queue (max concurrency 1–2); cap `m_previewChannels`; add per-channel/per-minute throttling
- [x] Compiler warning cleanup — fix `-Wconversion` narrowing (qsizetype→int), `-Wshadow` locals, `-Wold-style-cast` casts flagged by the new warning flags

### Medium term
- [x] Incremental nick-list updates — emit specific `nickAdded`/`nickRemoved`/`nickRenamed`/`nickModeChanged` signals; replace `clear()`/repopulate with targeted updates; batch during NAMES/netsplit bursts
- [x] Per-channel nick index — `QHash<QString, int> nickIndex` (lower nick → index) to replace O(n) scans in `onMessage`, `onNotice`, `onAction`, `onAccountChanged`
- [x] Batch chat/nick refreshes — debounce `refreshChatView()` and `refreshNickList()` with a short single-shot timer for burst updates
- [x] Split `ChatRenderer` out of `MainWindow` — `formatMessage`, `ircToHtml`, `linkifyHtml`, emoji rendering as a separate class
- [x] Split `CommandDispatcher` out of `MainWindow` — `/join`, `/msg`, `/dcc`, `/sysinfo`, etc. as a separate class
- [x] Parser and model unit tests — `IrcParserTest` (prefixes/tags/CTCP/malformed), `ChatFormatTest` (HTML escaping/linkification); `SessionModelTest` deferred (needs mock IrcClient)

### Bigger / architectural
- [x] Keychain operations async — remove nested `QEventLoop` in `KeychainHelper`; load non-secret config first, then resolve secrets before connecting; avoids reentrancy hazard
- [x] Targeted chat block updates — `BlockMsgid` userData tags each QTextBlock; onReactionsChanged and onMessageRedacted do targeted insert/replace/remove instead of full rebuild (v0.23.3)
- [ ] IrcParser fuzz target — libFuzzer harness around `IrcParser::parseLine()` for parser regression coverage
- [ ] `ServerId` / `BufferId` strong types — replace stringly-typed host/channel routing; prerequisite for robust multi-network and bouncer support

---

## Known Issues

- DCC over internet (active mode) — active DCC advertises your local IP; if both sides are behind NAT the connection still fails. Use **Send File (Passive)** so the receiver opens the port instead.
- DCC passive receive over NAT — the receiver's port must be reachable from outside. If the receiver is also behind NAT, passive DCC will not work either (both sides blocked). No relay mechanism implemented.
