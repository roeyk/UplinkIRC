## CTCP

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ping <nick>` | Send a CTCP PING to a user — reply shows round-trip time in the active channel |
| `/time <nick>` | Ask a user for their local time — reply appears in the active channel |
| `/version [nick]` | Request server version, or CTCP VERSION from a nick |
| `/ctcp <nick> <command> [args]` | Send a raw CTCP request to a user |
| `/sysinfo` | Post OS, CPU, RAM, GPU, and uptime info to the current channel |

Incoming CTCP VERSION and PING requests are answered automatically.

> **Note:** `/time` and `/ping` only work if the target client supports those CTCP commands. Most IRC clients do, but bots often do not respond. If you see no reply, the other side simply does not support it.

### Examples

```
/ping alice
/time alice
/version
/version alice
/ctcp alice CLIENTINFO
/sysinfo
```

## File transfer (DCC)

DCC Send is initiated from the **nick list right-click menu**, not a slash command.

**Sending a file:**

1. Right-click any nick in the user list on the right side of the window.
2. Choose **Send File**.
3. Pick a file in the file dialog.
4. A progress dialog appears while UplinkIRC waits for the recipient to accept.

**Receiving a file:**

When someone sends you a file, a dialog appears:

```
alice wants to send you:
report.pdf  (2.1 MB)

Accept?   [Yes]  [No]
```

Click **Yes**, choose a save location, and a progress dialog tracks the download. Click **Cancel** at any time to abort.

> **NAT note:** DCC works directly between clients over TCP. It works reliably on the same LAN. Over the internet, it requires the sender's port to be reachable — NAT or a firewall on the sender's side will block the connection. This is a fundamental DCC limitation, not an UplinkIRC bug.

## Raw IRC protocol

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/raw <line>` | Send a raw IRC protocol line directly to the server |
| `/quote <line>` | Alias for `/raw` |

Use these when you need to send a command that UplinkIRC does not have a built-in shortcut for yet.

### Examples

```
/raw MODE #uplink +m
/raw INVITE alice #uplink
/quote JOIN #test
```

---

## Help

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Print a list of all available commands in the current chat buffer |

---

## Emoji

UplinkIRC has two ways to insert emoji:

### Emoji picker button
Click ☰ to open **Preferences** and check **Show Emoji Button** (or set `show_emoji_button = true` in config). Click the 😊 button next to the input box to open a searchable grid of ~400 emoji.

### :shortcode: typing
Type a colon followed by a keyword and a completion list appears:

| You type | Result |
|---|---|
| `:smi` | autocomplete list: 😄 smile, 😃 smiley, … |
| `:trident:` | auto-replaces to 🔱 as soon as you type the closing `:` |
| `:fire:` + Enter | sends 🔥 in the message |

- Use **Up/Down** arrows to navigate the list, **Enter** or **Tab** to confirm, **Escape** to dismiss.
- Any `:shortcode:` patterns still in the text when you press Enter are resolved before the message is sent.

---

## Notes

- Commands are case-insensitive: `/JOIN` works the same as `/join`.
- Any input that does not start with `/` is sent as a regular message to the current channel or user.
- If you want to send a message that starts with `/` literally, prefix it with a space.
