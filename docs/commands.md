## Nick and identity

| Command | Description |

## Connection & IRC operator

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/quit [message]` | Disconnect from the current server. If no message is given, uses the server's configured `quit_message` (default: `"Uplink"`) |
| `/motd [server]` | Request the message of the day |
| `/list` | Open the channel browser — a sortable dialog showing all channels with user count and topic; type to filter, double-click or press Join to join |
| `/stats <query>` | Request server statistics — `u`=uptime, `o`=opers, `m`=commands |
| `/time` | Query the server's local time |
| `/oper <user> <pass>` | IRC operator login — sends `OPER user :pass` to the server |

### Examples

```
/quit                    # uses configured quit_message (default: "Uplink")
/quit later everyone     # overrides for this disconnect only
/motd
/list
/stats u
/stats o
/time
/oper myname mysecretpassword
```

---

## CTCP

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ping <nick>` | Send a CTCP PING to a user — reply shows round-trip time in the active channel |
| `/time <nick>` | Ask a user for their local time via CTCP — reply appears in the active channel |
| `/version [nick]` | Request server version, or CTCP VERSION from a nick |
| `/ctcp <nick> <command> [args]` | Send a raw CTCP request to a user |
| `/sysinfo` | Collect OS, CPU, RAM, GPU, and uptime info and post it to the current channel — asks for confirmation before posting |

Incoming CTCP VERSION and PING requests are answered automatically.

> **Note:** `/sysinfo` collects info in the background (GPU detection via `vulkaninfo`/`lspci` can take a moment). Uplink posts "Collecting system info…" immediately, then replaces it with the result when ready. A 12-second timeout applies — if collection hangs, an error is posted instead.

> **Note:** `/time` and `/ping` only work if the target client supports those CTCP commands. Most IRC clients do, but bots often do not respond. If you see no reply, the other side simply does not support it.

### Examples

```
/ping alice
/time alice
/version
/version alice
/ctcp alice CLIENTINFO
/sysinfo
```

## File transfer (DCC)

DCC Send is initiated from the **nick list right-click menu**, not a slash command.

Uplink supports two DCC modes. Choose based on your network situation:

| Mode | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Send File** (active) | You have a reachable port — direct internet connection, or your router has port forwarding set up. The sender listens; the recipient connects in. |
| **Send File (Passive)** | You are behind NAT (home router, VPN) and cannot accept incoming connections. The recipient opens the port instead and you connect out to them. |

**Sending a file (active mode):**

1. Right-click any nick in the user list on the right side of the window.
2. Choose **Send File**.
3. Pick a file in the file dialog.
4. A progress dialog appears. Transfer begins as soon as the recipient accepts.

**Sending a file (passive mode — use if you're behind NAT):**

1. Right-click the recipient's nick.
2. Choose **Send File (Passive)**.
3. Pick a file. Uplink sends the offer with `port=0` — signalling that the recipient should open the port.
4. The recipient's client opens a port and sends you its address. Uplink then connects out to them automatically.
5. A progress dialog tracks the transfer.

**Receiving a file:**

When someone sends you a file (either mode), a dialog appears:

```
alice wants to send you:
report.pdf  (2.1 MB)

Accept?   [Yes]  [No]
```

Click **Yes**, choose a save location, and a progress dialog tracks the download. Click **Cancel** at any time to abort.

The file is written to a `.part` file while downloading and renamed to the final filename only when the transfer completes successfully. If the transfer is cancelled or fails, the partial file is deleted automatically.

**Receive limits:**

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Maximum file size | 2 GiB |
| Disk space | Checked against available space before starting — transfer is rejected if there is not enough room |

> **NAT and firewalls:** Active DCC requires the sender's port to be reachable from the internet. If the sender is behind a home router, use **Send File (Passive)** — this flips who opens the port. If *both* sides are behind NAT, neither mode will work without a relay.

## Sidebar right-click menu

Right-clicking a **channel** in the sidebar opens a context menu:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Open in Pane** | Opens the channel as a side-by-side pane with its own chat view, nick list, topic bar, and input bar. Appears when the channel is not already open in a pane. Pane layout is saved automatically and restored on the next launch. |
| **Close Pane** | Closes the side-by-side pane for this channel. Appears when a pane is already open. |
| **Rejoin** | Parts the channel and immediately rejoins it. |
| **Leave** | Parts the channel (`PART`). |
| **Close** | Closes the buffer without sending a `PART` (use after a kick, for example). |

Right-clicking a **server header** shows:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Disconnect** | Sends `QUIT` and closes the connection. |
| **Reconnect** | Re-connects to the server using the current config. |

---

## Nick list right-click menu

Right-clicking any nick — in the user list or directly on a nick link in the chat view — opens the same context menu. The title shows the nick in bold.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Message** | Opens a private message buffer in the sidebar. Equivalent to `/msg nick`. |
| **Send File** | Opens a file picker and sends the file via active DCC. Use when you have a reachable port. |
| **Send File (Passive)** | Same as Send File, but the recipient opens the port instead. Use when you are behind NAT. |
| **Whois** | Sends `WHOIS nick`. The response appears in the active channel. |
| **Invite** | Opens a dialog pre-filled with the current channel. Edit if needed and click OK to send `INVITE nick #channel`. |
| **Give Op** | Sets `+o` on the nick. Requires op. |
| **Take Op** | Removes `-o` from the nick. Requires op. |
| **Give Voice** | Sets `+v` on the nick. Requires op or half-op. |
| **Take Voice** | Removes `-v` from the nick. Requires op or half-op. |
| **Version** | Sends a CTCP VERSION request. Reply appears in the active channel. |
| **Ping** | Sends a CTCP PING. Reply shows RTT in the active buffer: `Ping reply from nick: Xms`. |
| **Copy Nick** | Copies the nickname to the clipboard. |
| **Ignore / Unignore** | Suppresses private messages, notices, and invites from this nick. Channel messages are always visible — ignore only affects private communication. The label toggles to **Unignore** if the nick is already ignored. For per-type control, use `/ignore nick [pm] [notice] [invite]` in the input bar. Persists in config. |
| **Kick** | Prompts for an optional reason, then kicks. Requires op. |
| **Ban** | Sets `MODE #channel +b nick!*@*`. Requires op. |
| **Kick & Ban** | Bans first, then kicks (correct order). Prompts for reason. Requires op. |

### Examples

```
# Right-click alice → Invite
# Dialog pre-filled: #uplink   → click OK
# Sends: INVITE alice #uplink

# Right-click spammer → Kick & Ban
# Reason dialog: "flooding"
# Sends: MODE #uplink +b spammer!*@*
#         KICK #uplink spammer :flooding

# Right-click alice → Ping
# Buffer: Ping reply from alice: 42ms
```

## Reactions

Uplink supports IRCv3 `draft/react` — emoji reactions attached to specific messages.

**Sending a reaction:**
- Right-click any message **timestamp** in the chat view → **React** → the emoji picker opens; search by name (e.g. `thumbs`, `:fire`) and click the emoji, or type a shortcode like `:poop:` and press Enter
- Or use `/react <emoji>` after right-clicking a timestamp and choosing **Reply** (sets the message target)

**Receiving reactions:**
- Reactions appear inline below the original message as `emoji(count)` whenever they are received

**Requirements:** the server must support the `draft/react` capability. If the server does not advertise it, reactions are silently skipped.

### Examples

```
# Right-click a timestamp → React → emoji picker opens → click 👍 or type :thumbsup: Enter

# Via slash command (requires a reply target set first):
/react 🔥
/react 👍
```

---

## Message timestamp right-click

Right-clicking a message **timestamp** (the `hh:mm` at the left of each line) opens a context menu for that specific message:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Reply** | Sets this message as the reply target. A `↩ nick` bar appears above the input. Press Enter to send; Escape to cancel. |
| **React** | Opens the emoji picker. Search by name or shortcode, click an emoji or press Enter to send it as an IRCv3 `draft/react` reaction. Requires server support for `draft/react`. |

---

## Raw IRC protocol

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/raw <line>` | Send a raw IRC protocol line directly to the server |
| `/quote <line>` | Alias for `/raw` |
| `/<ANY>` | Any unrecognized slash command is sent as a raw IRC line automatically |

Use these when you need to send a command that Uplink does not have a built-in shortcut for yet. You can also just type the command directly — unrecognized `/CMD` inputs are passed through to the server as-is.

### Examples

```
/raw MODE #uplink +m
/raw INVITE alice #uplink
/quote JOIN #test

/REHASH
/SAMODE #uplink +o alice
/GLOBOPS Hello opers
```

---

## Help

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Print a list of all available commands in the current chat buffer |

---

---

## Emoji

Uplink has two ways to insert emoji:

### Emoji picker button
Click ☰ to open **Preferences** and check **Show Emoji Button** (or set `show_emoji_button = true` in config). Click the 😊 button next to the input box to open a searchable grid of ~400 emoji.

### :shortcode: typing
Type a colon followed by a keyword and a completion list appears:

| You type | Result |
|---|---|
| `:smi` | autocomplete list: 😄 smile, 😃 smiley, … |
| `:trident:` | auto-replaces to 🔱 as soon as you type the closing `:` |
| `:fire:` + Enter | sends 🔥 in the message |

- Use **Up/Down** arrows to navigate the list, **Enter** or **Tab** to confirm, **Escape** to dismiss.
- Any `:shortcode:` patterns still in the text when you press Enter are resolved before the message is sent.

---

## Notes

- Commands are case-insensitive: `/JOIN` works the same as `/join`.
- Any input that does not start with `/` is sent as a regular message to the current channel or user.
- If you want to send a message that starts with `/` literally, prefix it with a space.
