# FAQ & Troubleshooting

Common questions and fixes for UplinkIRC.

---

## Installation & startup

### Where do I get UplinkIRC?

Build from source — see [Building](building.md) for step-by-step instructions. Packages for Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Windows are planned.

### A nick dialog appeared on first launch — what do I do?

UplinkIRC detected that your config still has the placeholder nick `yournick`. Type your desired nickname in the dialog and click OK. It will be saved to your config and used for all servers on the next connect.

### themes/ folder missing — no themes load

The `themes/` folder must be in the same directory as the `UplinkIRC` binary (or at `~/.config/LinuxDojo/UplinkIRC/themes/`). If you moved the binary, copy the folder back:

```bash
cp -r themes/ /path/to/your/binary/
```

If you built with CMake, themes are copied to the build directory automatically via a post-build step.

## Configuration

### Where is my config file?

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux / FreeBSD | `~/.config/LinuxDojo/UplinkIRC/config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/LinuxDojo/UplinkIRC/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\LinuxDojo\UplinkIRC\config.toml` |

Open it in any text editor and restart UplinkIRC to apply changes.

### My config change isn't taking effect

UplinkIRC reads the config once at startup. After editing `config.toml`, close and reopen the app. Live reload is planned for a future release.

### TOML parse error on startup

All string values in TOML must be wrapped in double quotes. The `#` character starts a comment outside of strings, which trips up channel names.

```toml
# Wrong — causes a parse error
name = LinuxDojo
channels = [#uplink]

# Correct
name     = "LinuxDojo"
```

For channels, each one needs its own `[[server.channels]]` block:

```toml
[[server.channels]]
name = "#uplink"

[[server.channels]]
name = "#linux"
```

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the full format reference.

### Where do I set the channel to auto-join?

Add a `[[server.channels]]` block inside the server entry:

```toml
[[server]]
name     = "LinuxDojo"
host     = "irc.linuxdojo.org"
port     = 6697
ssl      = true
nick     = "yournick"
user     = "uplink"
realname = "UplinkIRC User"

[[server.channels]]
name = "#uplink"
```

---

## Connecting & IRC

### Can I connect to multiple servers at once?

Yes. Add multiple `[[server]]` blocks in your config — each gets its own entry in the sidebar and connects independently.

```toml
[[server]]
name     = "LinuxDojo"
host     = "irc.linuxdojo.org"
port     = 6697
ssl      = true
nick     = "yournick"
user     = "uplink"
realname = "UplinkIRC User"

[[server.channels]]
name = "#uplink"

[[server]]
name     = "Libera"
host     = "irc.libera.chat"
port     = 6697
ssl      = true
nick     = "yournick"
user     = "uplink"
realname = "UplinkIRC User"

[[server.channels]]
name = "#linux"
```

### UplinkIRC disconnected — will it reconnect?

Not automatically yet. Auto-reconnect with backoff is planned. For now, close and reopen the app to reconnect.

### How do I send a raw IRC command?

Use `/raw` followed by the full IRC line:

```
/raw PRIVMSG #uplink :hello
/raw MODE #uplink +m
/raw WHOIS alice
```

`/quote` works as an alias for `/raw`.

### My nick was already in use — what happened?

If your preferred nick is taken, UplinkIRC appends `_` and tries again (e.g. `yournick_`). You will see the new nick reflected next to the input box. Use `/nick yournick` once the original nick becomes available.

### How do I join a channel while connected?

Type `/join #channelname` in the input box and press Enter.

### How do I use a bouncer (ZNC or soju)?

Set the `password` field in your server block. UplinkIRC sends it as `PASS` before registration, which is how bouncers authenticate.

ZNC format — `username/network:password`:

```toml
[[server]]
name     = "ZNC"
host     = "znc.example.com"
port     = 6697
ssl      = true
nick     = "yournick"
user     = "uplink"
realname = "UplinkIRC User"
password = "joe/libera:mysecretpassword"
```

soju format — `username:password`:

```toml
[[server]]
name     = "soju"
host     = "soju.example.com"
port     = 6697
ssl      = true
nick     = "yournick"
user     = "uplink"
realname = "UplinkIRC User"
password = "joe:mysecretpassword"
```

## Interface

### How do I change the theme?

Open **Hamburger menu → Theme** and pick from the list. The theme applies immediately. To make it the default, set `theme` in `config.toml`:

```toml
[ui]
theme = "nord"
```

### How do I move the nick list?

The nick list panel is a floating dock — drag its title bar to the left or right to reposition it. The position is not persisted yet (window state persistence is planned).

### How do I hide the topic bar?

Open **Hamburger menu** and toggle the **Topic** option. You can also set it in config:

```toml
[ui]
show_topic = false
```

### How do I hide my nick next to the input box?

Open **Hamburger menu** and toggle the **Nick** option. Or set it in config:

```toml
[ui]
show_nick_prefix = false
```

### How do I change the app icon?

Open **Hamburger menu → App Icon** and choose **Default** (flat satellite dish) or **Alternative** (3D satellite). The choice is saved and persists across restarts.

### The emoji button doesn't do anything

The emoji picker UI is not built yet. Toggle the emoji button in the hamburger menu to show or hide the button — the picker will be wired up in a future release.

### How do I minimize to the system tray?

Close the window normally — it minimizes to the system tray instead of quitting. Left-click the tray icon to bring the window back. Right-click for a menu with **Show** and **Quit**.

## Building from source

### What do I need to build UplinkIRC?

- CMake 3.16 or newer
- Qt 6.2 or newer (Widgets + Network + Ssl modules)
- A C++17 compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- tomlplusplus (header-only, available via most package managers)

See [Building](building.md) for full platform-specific instructions.

### Build fails: "tomlplusplus not found"

Install the package for your platform:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S tomlplusplus

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install libtomlplusplus-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install tomlplusplus-devel

# FreeBSD
sudo pkg install tomlplusplus

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install tomlplusplus
```

### Build fails: Qt6 not found

Make sure Qt6 is installed and CMake can find it. If Qt is in a non-standard location, pass the prefix:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt6 ..
```
