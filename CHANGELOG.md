Session summary — 2026-05-28 sprint #3:

What was built:
  - PM tabs: incoming PRIVMSGs open a sidebar buffer named after the sender.
    /msg <nick> opens the buffer and switches to it. Outgoing messages echo
    into the PM buffer. openPM() in SessionModel emits channelAdded for new
    conversations.
  - Nick list right-click menu: nick name (bold, disabled title), Message,
    Send File (disabled — DCC pending), Whois, Give Op, Give Voice, Version.
    Clean nick stored in Qt::UserRole on each list item.
  - Tray icon left-click now toggles window visibility (hide if visible,
    show+raise if hidden).
  - Unread indicator: dot only (● #channel) in sidebar — no color/bold change
    on the channel text. Tray badge removed entirely.
  - Sidebar flat list redesign: no expand arrows, no collapse, servers as
    muted uppercase section headers. Small grey circle icon on connected
    server. Branch lines hidden via QSS. Dock title bars ("Servers",
    "Users (N)") removed. Server header hover no longer causes visual shift.
  - Font Config additions: Network Name and Typing Indicator size controls
    (font_server_header, font_typing). Both persist to config.toml.
  - Nick list item padding tightened (1px vs 2px).
  - Topic bar redesign: info bar always visible showing #channel (modes)
    left and "* NetworkName — N users" right. User count updates live.
    Separate topic display (bufferBg background) drops below when Show Topic
    is toggled. Topic no longer appears inline in the info bar.
  - Channels indented 8px from server name (was 14px).

Bugs fixed:
  - Modes never populated in info bar because MODE #channel was never
    requested; fixed by sending MODE after 366 RPL_ENDOFNAMES.
  - Topic text was stored but never displayed; now shown in topic display.
  - CLAUDE.md was tracked in git despite being in .gitignore; untracked.
    AI-referencing language stripped from changelog comment blocks.

Known issues left open:
  - No reconnect on disconnect
  - DCC Send File not implemented
  - Emoji picker not built
  - Halloy-style sidebar/userlist aesthetic not fully matched

Session summary — 2026-05-28 doc audit:

What was done:
  Full audit of all documentation against actual implemented features.
  Found and fixed stale/wrong content across three files:

  docs/index.html:
    - Version badge updated v0.1.0 → v0.2.0 (nav + footer)
    - SASL cap entry changed from "planned" (grey) to "active" (green)
    - draft/typing cap added as active (was missing entirely)
    - Two new feature cards added: SASL & NickServ, Persistent layout

  docs/faq.md:
    - "position is not persisted yet" updated to reflect panel persistence fix
    - Stale App Icon Picker FAQ removed (feature was removed from UI)
    - New entry: NickServ auto-identify setup with full config example
    - New entry: SASL PLAIN setup with full config example and network advice

  docs/ircv3.md:
    - SASL section moved from Planned to Active; updated to describe PLAIN
      implementation, config keys, and 903/904/906 handling
    - draft/typing added as new Active section with description

Known issues left open:
  - Emoji picker not built
  - No reconnect on disconnect

Session summary — 2026-05-28 sprint #2:

What was built:
  - NickServ IDENTIFY auto: nickserv_password in [[server]] config;
    PRIVMSG NickServ :IDENTIFY sent immediately after 001 RPL_WELCOME.
  - Toolbar unified with sidebar: toolbar, status bar, hamburger button
    all use sidebarBg; no border lines; QToolBar::handle zeroed; toolbar
    layout margins zeroed; no right-click context menu.
  - "Uplink" label removed from toolbar.
  - Hamburger size doubled (font * 2); flush left with no padding.
  - Panel size persistence: QMainWindow saveGeometry/saveState saved to
    QSettings on quit (connected via aboutToQuit signal); restored in
    constructor. Max-width caps on sidebar and nick list removed so panels
    can be freely dragged.
  - Topic bar fixed: channel+modes combined on left (m_topicLabel),
    topic text in middle with stretch (m_modesLabel), server name right.
    MODE #channel sent after 366 RPL_ENDOFNAMES so modes always arrive.
  - /sysinfo full rewrite: format OS: ... CPU: ... MEM: ... GPU: ... UP: ...
    GPU from vulkaninfo --summary (deviceName + last-parens of driverInfo
    e.g. RADV STRIX1), lspci fallback. Uptime from /proc/uptime parsed to
    days/hours/minutes/seconds. MEM is total GB rounded. CPU is model name
    only (no thread count). OS is "Linux (Name version) (kernel)".
    FreeBSD uptime from kern.boottime sysctl.

Bugs fixed:
  - Topic bar showed empty modes because MODE #channel was never requested;
    fixed by sending MODE after 366 end-of-names.
  - Topic text stored in ch->topic was never displayed; now shown in bar.
  - /sysinfo CPU showed "x86_64" (arch fallback) because /proc/cpuinfo
    parsing stopped before finding model name line. Fixed in rewrite.
  - /sysinfo RAM showed "Unknown" for same reason — MEM field now reads
    MemTotal only (no MemAvailable), clean and reliable.

Known issues left open:
  - Release workflow end-to-end not yet confirmed (needs a tag push)
  - SASL EXTERNAL not implemented
  - No reconnect on disconnect
  - Emoji picker not yet built

Next priorities:
  - Reconnect with backoff
  - Connection status indicator per server
  - AppImage packaging
-->

Session summary — 2026-05-28 sprint:

What was built:
  - /help command: lists all available slash commands in the active chat buffer
    as Server-type messages. One appendMessage call per line for clean display.
  - /sysinfo rewritten: replaces the old Qt-only QSysInfo one-liner with real
    system data. On Linux reads /etc/os-release (PRETTY_NAME), /proc/cpuinfo
    (model name + thread count), /proc/meminfo (MemTotal/MemAvailable), and
    uname -r for kernel. On FreeBSD uses sysctl hw.model/hw.ncpu/hw.physmem/
    vm.stats.vm.v_free_count/hw.pagesize. macOS uses sysctl hw.model/hw.ncpu
    for CPU. Output format: OS: <name> | Kernel: <ver> | CPU: <model> (N threads) | RAM: <used>/<total>GB
  - SASL PLAIN: full IRCv3 SASL flow. Config keys sasl_user/sasl_password in
    [[server]] block. If set: sasl cap added to CAP REQ, CAP END held until
    SASL completes, AUTHENTICATE PLAIN sent on CAP ACK, base64(\0user\0pass)
    payload sent on AUTHENTICATE +. 903 success → CAP END. 904/905/906
    failure → CAP END + server message. Numerics 900/903/904/905/906 handled.

Bugs fixed:
  None — all three changes are new features with clean builds.

Known issues left open:
  - Release workflow end-to-end not yet confirmed (needs a tag push)
  - SASL EXTERNAL not implemented
  - No reconnect on disconnect
  - Emoji picker not yet built

Next priorities:
  - NickServ IDENTIFY auto
  - Reconnect with backoff
  - Connection status indicator per server
  - AppImage packaging

Session summary — initial build sprint:

What was built:
  Full Qt6/C++ IRC client from scratch. Project replaces DojoIRC (Go/Wails)
  with a native Qt Widgets app targeting smaller RAM footprint and long-session
  stability.

  Completed this sprint:
  - CMakeLists.txt with Qt6, tomlplusplus, POST_BUILD theme copy
  - TOML config loader (config.h/config.cpp) with full struct hierarchy:
    UiConfig, ServerConfig, ChannelConfig, Config
  - IRCv3 message parser (ircparser.h/cpp): tags, prefix, command, params
  - IrcClient (ircclient.h/cpp): QSslSocket TLS, CAP LS 302, all IRC
    numerics and commands, CTCP ACTION
  - Data model: Message, Channel (NickEntry + prefixRank), ServerSession,
    SessionModel (central hub with signal/slot wiring)
  - MainWindow: toolbar, hamburger menu, sidebar tree, nick dock,
    topic bar, chat view, input bar
  - TrayIcon: left-click shows window, right-click Show/Quit,
    unread red-dot badge, balloon notifications
  - AppIcons: maindefault.png / mainalt.png / about.png, user picks
    in hamburger, persists via QSettings
  - AboutDialog: horizontal logo (400x100), version, server info
  - ThemeLoader: 55 TOML themes, named {{key}} substitution (avoids
    Qt arg() %10+ mangling bug), live switching
  - First-run nick dialog if config has placeholder "yournick"
  - 55 theme files ported from DojoIRC

Bugs found and fixed:
  - Signal ordering: loadConfig() emitted signals before MainWindow
    connected them → sidebar/chat empty on launch.
    Fix: moved model->loadConfig() to after window.show() in main.cpp.
  - Qt arg() mangling: %10+ placeholders corrupted with >9 args.
    Fix: replaced all .arg() chaining with named {{key}} substitution
    via fill() helper and QHash.
  - QSS placeholder selector: used QLineEdit::placeholder (invalid),
    should be QLineEdit::placeholder-text. Fixed in themeloader.cpp.
  - Missing QListWidget forward declaration in mainwindow.h.
  - Missing QApplication include in mainwindow.cpp (qApp undefined).
  - qAsConst() deprecated in Qt6: replaced with std::as_const().
  - Default channel was #uplinkirc — corrected to #uplink throughout.

Known issues open:
  - Theme and icon choice persist via QSettings only, not config.toml.
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji button toggle visible but picker not yet built.
  - Documentation panel in hamburger opens nothing (not yet built).
  - Window position/dock layout not persisted.

Session summary — docs, repo, landing page sprint:

What was built:
  - Full documentation rewrite — all 5 docs/ files rewritten from scratch,
    all DojoIRC references removed. configuration.md, commands.md, faq.md,
    ircv3.md, keyboard-shortcuts.md now reflect actual v0.1.0 feature set
    and real config format ([[server.channels]] structure, [ui] block).
  - config.toml.example updated to match actual parser format.
  - README.md rewritten with real build instructions, per-platform dep
    install commands, feature list, config example, docs index.
  - version.h.in added — CMake configure_file bakes PROJECT_VERSION into
    version.h at build time. About dialog now shows version from header
    (UPLINKIRC_VERSION macro) instead of hardcoded string. To release:
    bump VERSION in CMakeLists.txt, rebuild, tag.
  - Global git commit-msg hook at ~/.config/git/hooks/commit-msg strips
    all AI co-author/attribution lines from every commit on this machine.
    git config --global core.hooksPath set to ~/.config/git/hooks.
  - GitHub repo created: https://github.com/joehonkey/UplinkIRC (public).
  - Branch protection on main — force push and deletion blocked.
  - GitHub Pages enabled from docs/ folder.
    Live at: https://joehonkey.github.io/UplinkIRC/
  - Landing page (docs/index.html) — dark Catppuccin design, hero with
    About.png logo, cross-platform section (Linux/FreeBSD/macOS/Windows/ARM64),
    feature cards, IRCv3 capability status grid, docs links, footer.
  - about.png resized from 2172px/894KB to 760px/143KB for fast page load.
    Optimized copy also written back to resources/icons/about.png.
  - Project rules updated: zero AI attribution anywhere, ever.

Bugs found and fixed:
  - about.png was 894KB (2172×724px) — invisible on dark hero background
    and slow to load. Fixed: resized to 760px wide, 143KB. White rounded
    card container added so logo is visible against dark background.

Known issues open:
  - Theme and icon choice persist via QSettings only, not config.toml.
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji picker not yet built.
  - In-app Documentation panel not yet built (resources/docs/ doesn't exist).
-->

<!--
Session summary — font and input bar polish:

What was built:
  - IBM Plex Mono set as default application font (size 10, monospace fallback hint).
    Applied via QApplication::setFont() in main.cpp before any window is created.
  - Nick prefix label background fix committed: moved QWidget#inputBar and
    QWidget#inputBar QLabel rules into the theme QSS template. Removed inline
    stylesheet from the inputBar widget. This was built last session but the code
    commit landed after the docs close — documented here for completeness.

Bugs found and fixed:
  - Nick prefix QLabel white-background artifact: confirmed fix committed as 63c89a9.

Known issues open:
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji picker not yet built.
-->

<!--
Session summary — icon, color codes, and input bar fix sprint:

What was built:
  - Synced ROADMAP/CHANGELOG: 4 commits from prior session landed after close had
    already run. Brought all docs surfaces back in line.
  - Single SVG icon: replaced maindefault.png, mainalt.png, about1.png with one
    uplink.svg. Added Qt6::Svg to CMakeLists.txt find_package and target_link_libraries.
    Removed icon picker submenu from hamburger. Removed `icon` field from UiConfig,
    config.cpp load/save, and config.toml. AppIcons simplified to two inline functions.
  - mIRC color code rendering: ircToHtml() static function in mainwindow.cpp processes
    raw IRC text before HTML insertion. Handles \x02 bold, \x1D italic, \x1F underline,
    \x1E strikethrough, \x16 reverse (fg/bg swap), \x03fg,bg color (16 mIRC colors),
    \x0F reset. Applied to Privmsg, Action, Notice message types.
  - Nick prefix label background fix: moved inputBar and nick label styling entirely into
    the theme QSS template (QWidget#inputBar, QWidget#inputBar QLabel rules). Removed
    inline stylesheet from the inputBar widget. Fixes white-box artifact caused by Qt's
    stylesheet inheritance breaking background:transparent on children of styled parents.

Bugs found and fixed:
  - Nick prefix QLabel rendered with white background on themed builds. Root cause: Qt
    does not correctly propagate background:transparent through parent widgets that have
    inline stylesheets. Fix: remove inline stylesheet from inputBar, move all input bar
    styling into the theme QSS where Qt can resolve it in one pass.

Known issues open:
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji picker not yet built.

<!--
Session summary — UX features + docs panel sprint:

What was built:
  - Nick completion: Tab key at end of a word looks up matching nicks in the
    current channel's nick list and cycles through them on repeated presses.
  - Input history: Up/Down arrow in the input bar cycles through previously
    sent messages per-channel (standard IRC client behavior).
  - Colored nicks: consistent hash-based color per nick applied in chat view
    and nick list. Toggle in hamburger menu, persists to config.toml.
  - In-app Documentation panel: Hamburger → Documentation opens a QDialog
    (DocsDialog) with a tab per doc file rendered as plain text. New files:
    src/ui/docsdialog.h, src/ui/docsdialog.cpp. Resources registered in
    resources.qrc.
  - Save theme + icon to config.toml: previously these only persisted via
    QSettings. Now written back to config file on change so they survive
    reinstall / config copy.
  - About.png logo added to README.md hero section.
  - Configuration doc updated with icon key table.
  - Keyboard shortcuts doc updated — Tab/Up/Down marked as implemented.

Bugs found and fixed:
  - about.png had a white background that rendered invisible against the dark
    GitHub Pages hero section. Fix: normalized background to transparent /
    dark-compatible. Updated both docs/about.png and resources/icons/about.png.
  - Input bar config/QSettings interaction had a minor inconsistency causing
    prefs not to round-trip correctly on first launch after a clean config.
    Fixed in config.cpp.

Known issues open:
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect — must restart app.
  - Emoji picker not yet built (button toggle is wired).
-->

<!--
Session summary — CI green sprint:

What was fixed:
  - CI was failing on Windows only. Linux and macOS were already passing after
    the per-platform Qt install switch. Windows aqtinstall was using arch
    'win64_msvc2019_64' which doesn't exist for Qt 6.8.x — Qt 6.7+ moved to
    MSVC 2022 builds. Fixed: changed arch to 'win64_msvc2022_64'.
  - Windows runner was hitting a Python permission error on the Windows Store
    python.EXE stub. Fixed: added explicit actions/setup-python@v5 step before
    jurplel/install-qt-action so aqtinstall gets a clean Python install.
  - Both fixes applied to ci.yml and release.yml.
  - All three platforms (ubuntu-24.04, windows-latest, macos-latest) now pass.

Known issues open:
  - Release workflow not yet confirmed end-to-end (no new tag pushed this session).
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji picker not yet built.
-->

<!--
Session summary — v0.2.0 sprint:

What was built:
  - Sidebar: server item is now the server buffer — clicking "LinuxDojo" (or
    whatever the server short name is) opens the server message buffer.
    The redundant "(server)" child item is gone. Short name pulled from config.
  - Per-widget font config: Font Config dialog in hamburger lets the user set
    independent font sizes for Toolbar, Sidebar, Chat, User List, Users Title,
    Topic Bar, Nick Label, and Input. Family picker + live preview. Persists to
    config.toml under font_* keys.
  - Topic bar replaced with channel info bar: shows #channel (modes) ServerName
    all left-aligned. Modes come from actual server data (324 RPL_CHANNELMODEIS
    now parsed). No toggle button — hamburger "Show Topic Bar" controls the bar.
    Bar uses theme sidebarBg color so it works correctly on dark themes.
  - Typing indicator: IRCv3 draft/typing via TAGMSG. Sends typing=active after
    1s debounce, typing=done on send or clear. Receives and displays "nick is
    typing..." above the input bar. Per-nick 6s auto-clear. Hamburger toggle,
    on by default.
  - CTCP: auto-replies to incoming VERSION and PING. CTCP replies shown in server
    buffer. Outgoing CTCP via /ctcp command.
  - New slash commands: /away, /back, /motd, /whois, /topic, /kick, /notice,
    /version, /ctcp, /sysinfo. Version string sourced from version.h macro.
  - Colored nicks toggle added to hamburger menu (was config-only before).
  - GitHub Actions CI: per-platform Qt install (apt on Linux, aqtinstall on
    Windows, Homebrew on macOS). Builds on every push to main.
  - GitHub Actions release workflow: builds Linux tarball, Windows zip (windeployqt),
    macOS dmg (macdeployqt) and attaches them to GitHub releases on tag push.
  - v0.2.0 tagged and pushed. Tag re-pushed to trigger release workflow.
  - CMakeLists.txt: FetchContent fallback for tomlplusplus so CI doesn't need
    the system package.

Bugs fixed:
  - 324 RPL_CHANNELMODEIS was never parsed — channel modes always empty on join.
    Fixed: ircclient.cpp now handles numeric 324 and emits modesReceived.
    modesChanged signal added to SessionModel so the UI refreshes.
  - Topic bar used palette(mid) background which rendered invisible on dark themes.
    Fixed: objectName "topicBar" + QSS rule using theme sidebarBg/border colors.
  - CI failing: jurplel/install-qt-action with Qt 6.7.3 caused aqt package-not-found
    errors on all platforms. Fixed: Linux uses apt, Windows aqtinstall 6.8.2,
    macOS Homebrew. qtsvg is included in base Qt6 install, not a separate module.

Known issues open:
  - CI release workflow untested end-to-end (tag re-push happened after workflows
    were committed; outcome unknown at session close).
  - No auto-reconnect on disconnect.
  - Emoji picker not yet built.
  - /help command not yet implemented.

- Panel size persistence — sidebar and nick list sizes saved on quit, restored on launch; no more max-width caps
- Toolbar unified with sidebar — toolbar, status bar, hamburger all use `sidebarBg`; borders and handle gap removed; "Uplink" label removed; hamburger doubled in size and flush left; no right-click context menu
- Topic bar — shows `#channel (modes)` left, topic text middle, server name right; `MODE #channel` requested after join so modes always populate

**Fix:** Topic text was stored but never displayed — now shown in the topic bar  
**Fix:** Channel modes never populated — `MODE #channel` now sent after 366 RPL_ENDOFNAMES  
**Fix:** `/sysinfo` CPU showed `x86_64` fallback — fixed in rewrite
